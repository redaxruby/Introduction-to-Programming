#1.Use the each method of Array to iterate over [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and print out each value.
array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
array.each { |n| p n }

#2. Same as above, but only print out values greater than 5.
array.each { |n| p n if n > 5}

#3. Now, using the same array from #2, use the select method to extract all odd numbers into a new array.

p array.select { |n| n.odd? }

#4. Append "11" to the end of the original array. Prepend "0" to the beginning.

array << 11
array.unshift(0)
p array

#5. Get rid of "11". And append a "3".

array.pop[11]
array << 3
p array

#6. Get rid of duplicates without specifically removing any one value.

array.uniq!
p array

#7. What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?

#=> An array is more of a list of items while a hash contains keys and values which users can use to extract data from

#8. Create a Hash using both Ruby syntax styles.
hash = {}
hash = Hash.new

#9. Suppose you have a hash h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
#1 Get the value of key `:b`.
h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
p h[:b]
#2 Add to this hash the key:value pair `{e:5}`
h.merge!(e:5)
p h
#3 Remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5
h.each do |k,v|
	h.delete(k) if v < 3.5
end
p h

#10 Can hash values be arrays? Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)

# => yes

# e.g. array = [ 
					# { name: "bob", age: 40, height: 181cm},
					# { name: "joe", age: 30, height: 164cm} ]

#11. Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

#Given the following data structures. Write a program that moves the information from the array into the empty hash that applies to the correct person.

contacts["Joe Smith"][:address] = contact_data[0][1]
contacts["Joe Smith"][:phone] = contact_data[0][2]

puts "Joe's email is #{contacts["Joe Smith"][:email]}"

#ex14
#In exercise 12, we manually set the contacts hash values one by one. Now, programmatically loop or iterate over the contacts hash from exercise 12, and populate the associated data from the contact_data array. Hint: you will probably need to iterate over ([:email, :address, :phone]), and some helpful methods might be the Array shift and first methods.

fields = [:email, :address, :phone]

contacts.each do |name, hash|
	fields.each do |field|
		hash[field] = contact_data.shift
	end
end

#As a bonus, see if you can figure out how to make it work with multiple entries in the contacts hash.

contact_data = [
	["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"],
